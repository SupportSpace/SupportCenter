    os2, proginfo, qdos, tandem, theos, tops20, unix, vms, win32, and
    windll (Cosmin)
19. Add new longest_match in WIN64 assembler.  Must use the new makefile
    to compile it.  Also change win32/osdep.h to allow use of assembler
    for longest_match without using assembler for CRC.  THIS IS UNTESTED.

    windll/csharp (Adrian Maull, Ed)
 7. Moved check_for_windows() DOS checks to help and version screens but still

------------------------ June 26th 2005 version 2.32d ------------------
 1. Add directory search improvements to Win32 (within recursion, reuse attribs
    from directory lookup to avoid calling stat()).  win32/win32zip.c  (Johnny)
 2. Cache result of IsFileSystemOldFAT() to avoid repetitive system calls
    for identical information.  win32/win32.c  (Johnny)
 3. Add optimization to dosmatch(): apply alternate shortcut code when the
    pattern to match consists of one multichar wildcard ('*') followed
    by a fixed string.  util.c (Johnny)
------------------------ July 11th 2005 version 2.32e ------------------
 1. Add directory search improvements to MSDOS.  msdos/msdos.c (Johnny)

    b) In both Win32 and MSDOS, change getDirEntryAttr() into macro,
       saving one function call overhead
    c) Add explaining comment to optimized procname_{local} code
    d) In util.c, move "*literal" pattern-matching optimization from
       dosmatch() to recmatch(). Advantages:
       - optimization used for all systems
       - optimization applied to all occurences where a "*" is last wildcard
         in pattern
       - "dosmatch()" only preconditoning wrapper for matching workhorse
         "recmatch()", it should not implement matching algorithms itself
       - optimization not applied for WILD_STOP_AT_DIR option
    e) >>>disabled<<< "*literal" optimization for all MBCS-aware environments,
       because suspect that supplied optimization code is not MBCS-clean
       (for details see the comment within the patch), so IS NOT USED for
       win32 port!  Can force activation of match optimization by specifying
       conditional compilation symbol TEST_FOR_MBCS_CLEAN.
    (Christian)
 3. Add and move comments for directory search improvements.  util.c (Ed)
 4. In win32/win32.c, IsFileSystemOldFAT(), add declarations of static

    recursion, not just zip -r foo foo.  man/zip.1 (Ed)

------------------------ February 16th 2006 version 2.32n ------------------
 1. Remove trailing space from the default COMPILER_NAME.  unix/unix.c
    (Cosmin)
 2. Use FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS and a less demanding access mode
    in CreateFile() when retrieving file attributes.  Fixes a problem
    when adding a directory entry from an NTFS or a CDFS partition
    (i.e. one that stores timestamps using universal time), and the
    directory timestamp is not the same daylight savings time setting.
    The effect is an offset in the timestamp by one hour, if zip is
    built using NT_TZBUG_WORKAROUND. The problem is not exposed, however,
    if NO_W32TIMES_IZFIX is defined and Zip is neither linked against
