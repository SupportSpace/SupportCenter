libgpg-error
============

This is a library that defines common error values for all GnuPG
components.  Among these are GPG, GPGSM, GPGME, GPG-Agent, libgcrypt,
Libksba, DirMngr, Pinentry, SmartCard Daemon and more.

Installation
------------

Please read the file INSTALL!

Here is a quick summary:

1) Check that you have unmodified sources.  You can find instructions
   how to verify the sources below.  Don't skip this - it is an
   important step!

2) Unpack the archive.  With GNU tar you can do it this way:
   "tar xzvf libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz"

3) "cd libgpg-error-x.y"

4) "./configure"

5) "make"

6) "make install"


How to Verify the Source
------------------------

In order to check that the version of libgpg-error which you are going
to install is an original and unmodified copy of the original, you can
do it in one of the following ways:

a) If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can
   simply check the supplied signature:

   $ gpg --verify libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz.sig

   This checks that the detached signature libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz.sig
   is indeed a a signature of libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz.

   Please note that you have to use an old version of GnuPG to do all
   this stuff.  *Never* use the version which was built using the
   library you are trying to verify!

b) If you don't have any a trusted version of GnuPG, you can attempt
   to verify the MD5 checksum, using a trusted version of the md5sum
   program:

   $ md5sum libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz

   This should yield an output _similar_ to this:

   fd9351b26b3189c1d577f0970f9dcadc  libgpg-error-x.y.tar.gz

   Now check that this checksum is _exactly_ the same as the one
   published via the announcement list and probably via Usenet.
