This function initializes the global state of gnutls-extra library to defaults.

be usable.

@deftypefun {const char *} {gnutls_extra_check_version} (const char * @var{req_version})
@var{req_version}: the version to check

Check that the version of the gnutls-extra library is at minimum
the requested one and return the version string; return NULL if the
