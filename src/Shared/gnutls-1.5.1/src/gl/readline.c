/* This module is intended to be used when the application only needs

   readline library, it is recommended to require the readline library
   (or improve this module) rather than #if-protect part of your
   application (doing so would add assumptions of this module into
   your application).  The application should use #include
   "readline.h", that header file will include <readline/readline.h>
