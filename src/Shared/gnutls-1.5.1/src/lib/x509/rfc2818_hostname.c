/**
  * gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname - This function compares the given hostname with the hostname in the certificate
  * @cert: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t structure
  * @hostname: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name
  *
  * This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
  * the given hostname. This is a basic implementation of the matching 
  * described in RFC2818 (HTTPS), which takes into account wildcards,
  * and the subject alternative name PKIX extension.
  *
  * Returns non zero on success, and zero on failure.
