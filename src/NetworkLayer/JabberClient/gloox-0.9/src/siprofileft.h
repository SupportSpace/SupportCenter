  /**
   * @brief An implementation of the file transfer SI profile (XEP-0096).
   *
   * An SIProfileFT object acts as a 'plugin' to the SIManager. SIProfileFT
   * manages most of the file transfer functionality.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Create a new SIProfileFT object. It needs a ClientBase -derived object as well as a
   * SIProfileFTHandler -derived object that will receive file transfer-related events.
   * The naming comes from the fact that File Transfer (FT) is a profile of Stream Initiation (SI).
   * If you already use SI and the SIManager somewhere else, you should pass a pointer to that
   * SIManager object as third parameter to SIProfileFT's constructor.
   * @code
   * class MyFileTransferHandler : public SIProfileFTHandler
   * {
   *   // ...
   * };
   *
   * Client* client = new Client( ... );
   * // ...
   * MyFileTransferHandler* mh = new MyFileTransferHandler( ... );
   *
   * SIProfileFT* ft = new SIProfileFT( client, mh );
   * @endcode
   *
   * You are now, basically, ready to send and receive files.
   *
   * A couple of notes:
   * @li To be able to send files, you will need access to a SOCKS5 bytestream proxy (called
   * StreamHost)(not an ordinary SOCKS5 proxy). You should use Disco to query it for its host
   * and port and feed that information into SIProfileFT:
   * @code
   * ft->addStreamHost( JID( "proxy.server.dom" ), "101.102.103.104", 6677 );
   * @endcode
   * You should @b not hard-code this information (esp. host/IP and port) into your app since
   * the proxy may go down occasionally or vanish completely.
   *
   * @li When you finally receive a SOCKS5Bytestream via the SIProfileFTHandler, you will need
   * to integrate this bytestream with your mainloop, or put it into a separate thread (if
   * occasional blocking is not acceptable). You will need to call
   * @link gloox::SOCKS5Bytestream::connect() SOCKS5Bytestream::connect() @endlink.
   * @link gloox::SOCKS5Bytestream::connect() connect() @endlink will try to connect to each of the
   * given StreamHosts and block until it has established a connection with one of the them (or
   * until all attempts failed). Further, if you want to receive a file via the bytestream, you will
   * have to call recv() on the object from time to time.
   *
   * @li If you e.g. told Client to connect through a @link gloox::ConnectionHTTPProxy HTTP proxy @endlink
   * or a @link gloox::ConnectionSOCKS5Proxy SOCKS5 proxy @endlink, or any other ConnectionBase -derived
   * method, or even chains thereof, SIProfileFT will use the same connection types with the same
   * configuration to connect to the Stream Host/SOCKS5 proxy. If this is inappropriate because you have
   * e.g. a local SOCKS5 proxy inside your local network, use SOCKS5Bytestream::setConnectionImpl() to
   * override the above default connection(s).
   *
   * @li Do @b not delete a SOCKS5Bytestream manually. Use dispose() instead.
   *
   * @li Additionally to using external SOCKS5 proxies, you can use a SOCKS5BytestreamServer object
   * that gloox provides:
   * @code
   * SOCKS5BytestreamServer* server = new SOCKS5BytestreamServer( client->logInstance(), 1234 );
   * if( server->listen() != ConnNoError )
   *   printf( "port in use\n" );
   *
   * ft->addStreamHost( client->jid(), my_ip, 1234 );
   * ft->registerSOCKS5BytestreamServer( server );
   * @endcode
   * This listening server should then be integrated into your mainloop to have its
   * @link gloox::SOCKS5BytestreamServer::recv() recv() @endlink method called from time to time.
   * It is safe to put the server into its own thread.
   *
   * @li Using addStreamHost(), you can add as many potential StreamHosts as you like. However, you
   * should add the best options (e.g. the local SOCKS5BytestreamServer) first.
   *
   * When cleaning up, delete the objectes you created above in the opposite order of
   * creation:
   *
   * @code
   * delete server
   * delete ft;
   * delete client;
   * @endcode
   *
   * For usage examples see src/examples/ft_send.cpp and src/examples/ft_recv.cpp.
