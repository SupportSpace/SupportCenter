  /**
   * @brief This is an implementation of XEP-0045 (Multi-User Chat).
   *
   * Usage is pretty simple:
   *
   * Derrive an object from MUCRoomHandler and implement its virtuals:
   * @code
   * class MyClass : public MUCRoomHandler
   * {
   *   ...
   * };
   * @endcode
   *
   * Then create a new MUCRoom object and pass it a valid ClientBase, the desired full room JID,
   * your MUCRoomHandler-derived object, and an optional MUCRoomConfigHandler-derived object.
   * @code
   * void MyOtherClass::joinRoom( const std::string& room, const std::string& service,
   *                              const std::string& nick )
   * {
   *   MyClass *myHandler = new MyClass(...);
   *   JID roomJID( room + "@" + service + "/" + nick );
   *   m_room = new MUCRoom( m_clientbase, roomJID, myHandler, 0 );
   *   m_room->join();
   * }
   * @endcode
   *
   * When joining the room was successful, the various MUCRoomHandler functions will start to
   * be called. If joining was not successful, MUCRoomHandler::handleMUCError() will be called,
   * giving a hint at the reason for the failure.
   *
   * To set up your own room, or to configure an existing room, you should also derive a
   * class from MUCRoomConfigHandler and register it with the MUCRoom (either by using it
   * with MUCRoom's constructor, or by calling registerMUCRoomConfigHandler()).
   *
   * To quickly create an instant room, see InstantMUCRoom.
   *
   * To quickly create an instant room to turn a one-to-one chat into a multi-user chat,
   * see UniqueMUCRoom.
   *
   * To send a private message to a room participant, use
   * @link MessageSession gloox::MessageSession @endlink with the participant's full room JID
   * (room\@service/nick).
   *
   * XEP version: 1.21
   * @author Jakob Schroeter <js@camaya.net>
   * @since 0.9
